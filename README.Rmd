# Propagation-Loss-2020-2021

The goal of the Propagation-Loss-2020-2021 projecy is to estimate propagation loss from two sites on Borneo: Rungan landscape and Maliau Basin.

## Updated November 16 2020
Rungan Playbacks V1 and V2 use three sample files and calculate SNR.  
V1- Adds 60-seconds of noise on either side of selection and then calculates SNR over the entire selection.  
V2- Can add variable duration to calculate noise and then calculate the signal only for the selection. Although it is working the SNR values are incorrect.   

NOTE: V2 is better than V1 (for now)
