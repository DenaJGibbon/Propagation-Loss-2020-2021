## July 13th
Ran over two habitat types from Rungan
Want to add lines in the code to deal

## August 25th
Need to figure out how to deal with playbacks that span two recordings
For Rungan it appears that there is only one sound file 
If there is an appended number at the end of the file then can safely ignore

Link to the full Rungan dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ndGVGCN4gDMh-lz6HQ97ZqxtCw16KSsB?usp=sharing

Try to pull a few more from Google Drive?

NOTES: Maybe check noise estimates for second noise value

## Sept 21
Was able to run iteratively over files from Google drive
Isolated one set of paired playbacks to run test
Need to comment out line 153
Update Line 339 where characterization is added

## November 22, 2021
We need to think about the replicates with the 100 m over different times of day
